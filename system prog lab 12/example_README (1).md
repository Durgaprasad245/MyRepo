# Interactive Command Execution Program

This C program allows users to execute UNIX commands using all acceptable wildcards and special characters through a user-friendly interface. It utilizes pipes to communicate between processes, executing the entered command and displaying the output to the terminal.

## Instructions

### Compilation

To compile the C source file into an executable, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the C source file (`dnuthala.c`).
3. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    gcc -o dnuthala dnuthala.c
    ```

### Execution

Once the program is compiled, you can run the executable program by following these steps:

1. In the same terminal session, execute the compiled program by running the following command:

    ```bash
    ./dnuthala
    ```

2. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter UNIX commands with wildcards and special characters.
3. To exit the program, simply enter "quit" as the command.
